# Discretization
# ==============

# Task
# ----
#  - Create an ordinal attribute `file size` with the following 5 possible values
#    {tiny, small, medium, large, huge}.
#  - Implement both the equal width and equal frequency methods.
#  - Display the data on a plot.

# Solution
# --------

# We import the matplotlib submodule **pyplot**, to plot 2d graphics;
# following a widely used convention, we use the `plt` alias.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# We will use the **csv** module for reading in data from a file.
# We also need the **math** module for computing log.
import csv
import math

# This function returns k split-points using the equal width method.
# I.e., the distance between the split points is the same.
def splits_equalwidth():
    min_x = min(x)
    max_x = max(x)
    split_size = (max_x - min_x) / k
    split_points = []
    for i in range(k-1):
        sp = split_size * (i + 1)
        split_points.append(sp)
    return split_points

# This function returns k split-points using the equal frequency method.
# I.e., all splits have the same number of elements.
def splits_equalfreq():
    split_points = []
    split_freq = len(x) / k  # this is how many elements we want in each split
    freq = 0  # how many elements we have in the current split
    for val in sorted(x):  # iterate the points sorted by x value
        freq += 1
        if freq >= split_freq:
            split_points.append(val)
            freq = 0
    return split_points

# ### Read data from file
# The first attribute will be shown on the x dimension, the second on the y dimension.
# We know that the first attribute is the file size. We take the log of the value
# as it might be more meaningful for certain applications.
# The meaning of the second attribute is not important for this exercise.
x = []
y = []

    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter='\t')
    for row in csvreader:
        if len(row) == 2:  # if we have 2 fields in that line
            x.append(math.log(float(row[0])))  # we take the log of the values
            y.append(row[1])

# ### Plot original data
plt.clf()  # this is needed to clear the current figure (prevents multiple labels)
plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

# ### Discretize data

# This is the number of splits we want.
# We will need to find `k-1` split points. The `splits` variable will hold those.
