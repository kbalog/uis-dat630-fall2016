# Finding k-nearest neighbors using Eucledian distance
# ====================================================

# Task
# ----
#  - Generate n=100 random points in a two dimensional space. Let both
#    the x and y attributes be int values between 1 and 100.
#  - Display these points on a scatterplot.
#  - Select one of these points randomly (i.e., pick a random index).
#  - Find the k closest neighbors of the selected record (i.e., the k records
#    that are most similar to it) using the Eucledian distance.
#    The value of k is given (i.e., hard-coded).
#  - Display the selected record and its k closest neighbors in a distinctive
#    manner on the plot (e.g., using different colors).

# Solution
# --------

# We import the matplotlib submodule **pyplot**, to plot 2d graphics;
# following a widely used convention, we use the `plt` alias.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# The number of random points we want.
n = 100

# The number of nearest neighbors.
k = 5

# Generate random points with x and y coordinates.
